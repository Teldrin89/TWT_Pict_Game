# Pictionary Game with Python

Pictionary online game project with Python (based on Tech With Tim stream)

## Getting Started

Game is based of the Pygame Python library and will be hosted on Linode server.

### Prerequisites

This is an online game, hence you have to only follow the URL. There might be
an authentication option added to the game, hence you might be asked to register
user before playing.
If you want to improve the game or work on something else based of this project
here are the steps to setup similar environment:
```
1. The project was created with Python 3.6.6 64-bit version
2. There is a requirements.txt file that contains all required Python libraries
```

## Built With

* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) - The Python game dev library

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
